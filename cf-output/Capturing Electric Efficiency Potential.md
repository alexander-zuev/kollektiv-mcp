3  Executive summary  •   Absent any policy intervention, moderate growth in underlying UK electricity demand is projected to 2030, with two electrification scenarios likely to add to that growth  –   Underlying demand is projected to grow to ~411 TWh in 2030 (CAGR ~0.7%) ,   excluding impact of policy  –   Electrification of vehicles and heating could add an additional ~6-14% to electricity demand in 2030  •   We have identified ~146 TWh (~36% of total demand) of demand reduction potential in 2030 across all three sectors, of  which current policy is estimated to capture ~54 TWh (~37% of total potential)  –   Our analysis has focused on the 3 largest categories of abatement measures per sector which together are estimated to deliver ~122 TWh of savings (~84% of total potential)  –   Residential: top three measures have a potential of ~58 TWh reflecting CFL lighting, appliances and better insulation, of which ~53% is expected to be captured through current / planned policies (primarily Products Policy)  –   Services: top three measures have a potential of ~40 TWh, reflecting better insulation, lighting controls and HVAC, of which ~14% is expected to be captured through current / planned policies  –   Industrial: top three measures have a potential of ~24 TWh, reflecting pump, motor and boiler optimisation, of which ~4% is expected to be captured through current / planned policies  –   Impact of broad policies (e.g. CRC, CCAs) on electricity demand is expected to be incremental to specific policies  –   In 2020, the abatement potential is estimated at ~103 TWh of which ~65% is expected to be captured by current policy  •   Through stakeholder interviews, comparisons with other markets and supporting analysis, we have identified 11 key insights on barriers to capturing the remaining demand reduction potential including:  –   Insights generated through this process range from policy to market maturity & costs to segment specific barriers in residential, industrial and commercial  •   Design options  –   Design options can be split into 8 categories, each impacting a number of barriers. These range from market based mechanisms (financing, pricing) to mandate-based mechanisms (taxes, supplier obligations)  –   4 case examples: ISO New England, Public Utility Commission Texas, Connecticut Energy Saving & EPA Portfolio Manager selected for further analysis given market advancement in the US and mechanism applicability in UK EMR context  –   Key lessons and insights from cases indicate that in order for market based incentives to address barriers, they would need to enhance payback periods, overcome agency issues and mitigate uncertainty,### Page 5

This is due to   increase in savings per TWh saved . Between 2020 and 2030  •   Electricity price increases by 30%  •   CO   2   price increases by 160%,### Page 16

31  Source: Interviews  The interviews and international experience suggest 11 key findings on barriers  Policy 1  Residential 3  Commercial/ industrial 4  Market maturity and costs 2  Description  •   While policy seeks to address a number of barriers in the residential sector, barriers in the service and industrial sectors are less well addressed 1  A  •   The complex and ever changing policy landscape results in confusion and delays in EE investment B  •   The transaction costs and the effort needed to implement energy efficiency (EE) measures are often large compared with the benefits associated with EE investments  A  •   The EE market is not sufficiently developed to deliver on electricity efficiency opportunities B  •   Agency issues are important for rented accommodation. However, agency issues in ownership transfer do not appear to be a significant issue in the UK residential sector (unlike the US)  A  •   Behavioural change is a significant opportunity in the residential sector, with potential as high as ~15% (though this will diminish the remaining opportunity that can be captured by technical measures)  B  •   In the commercial and industrial sectors, stakeholders demand a rapid payback period of ~2 years while many EE investments have a longer payback period  A  •   Agency issues in the commercial sector appear to be a significant barrier as 61% of commercial space is leased and 75% of the corporate sector outsources its facilities management capabilities, often without incentives for reducing energy costs  B  •   While capital constraints may be a barrier for SMEs or underperforming companies, large commercial and industrial organisations can secure necessary financing to make an EE investment if attractive  C  •   Utility companies and many intensive industrial users largely focus on other energy sources to reach carbon targets  C  •   Electricity intensive users are focused on realising electricity demand reduction opportunities. However, non-electricity intensive industries represent ~60% of total industrial electricity demand and are less likely to achieve the full scale of opportunities  D  1 Does not take into account impact of CCAs as it is unclear how CCAs will affect this once they have been finalised,### Page 33
32  Policy – key insights (1/2)  Source: Interviews  1  1 Does not take into account impact of CCAs as it is unclear how CCAs will affect this once they have been finalised 2 Based on 9 sets of measures that deliver 80% of value  Complex and changing policy landscape is a challenge  B  •   The complex and ever changing policy landscape results in confusion and delays in EE investment  •   Several existing policies (e.g., CRC, CCAs, Solar FiTs) have changed significantly or are currently under review. Companies who were penalised by the changes in policy are now hesitant to make investments for fear that the policy environment will change again, rendering the investment uneconomic  –   Many new policies have been introduced in the last 2 years and there is a lack of clarity on what the landscape will look like going forward  –   Given the complex policy landscape, not all companies are aware of the existing EE incentives  Policy gap in commercial/ industrial sectors  A  •   While policy seeks to address a number of barriers in the residential sector, barriers in the commercial and industrial sectors are less well addressed   1  •   Policy captures 53% of the total residential opportunity, but only 14% of the opportunity in the service sector and 4% of the industrial opportunity 2  The biggest barrier is the shifting sands that the government has introduced by changing the goal posts (e.g., solar FiTs). This curtails investment. The carbon reduction landscape is extremely complex and I would like to see that simplified.  – Commercial user  There’s a mass of different assistance in EE areas. It’s bewildering- what’s on offer. I have never heard of the Enhanced Capital Allowance- maybe that could help some of our business cases  – Electricity intensive user  We would appreciate more visibility and stability in terms of policy. CRC has changed significantly and we still don’t know what it will look like tomorrow.  – Utility company,### Page 34

40  Market maturity and costs barriers – key insights  Source: Interviews  2  EE market not sufficiently developed  B  •   The EE market is not sufficiently developed to deliver on EE opportunities  –   While many companies are keen to be involved, the industry lacks the necessary depth of expertise, which is sometimes imported from the US and Europe  –   Users are sceptical whether the EE benefits realised will meet the level promised by EE suppliers  –   There is a perception that high prices and profit margins by EE providers can make EE products and services uncompetitive  High transactions costs for small projects  A  •   Transaction costs, including the effort needed to implement EE measures are often large compared to the benefits associated with EE investments across all sectors  •   Transactions costs include both financial and non-financial costs:  –   Financial costs include legal and accounting services  –   Time and trouble costs include time spent searching for information, project managements time and disruption costs  It can take anywhere up to 18 months to structure a big efficiency project and the management time involved is significant  – Green finance provider  There are high transaction costs associated with EE, such as closing the business for 2 days. £2,000 is the average annual bill for an SME customer. If you save £200, it’s not worth it. Even at twice that savings rate it doesn’t make sense.  – Utility company  The EE industry in the UK isn’t sufficiently developed in terms of quality and depth. ESCOs have to bring in people from outside”  – Green finance provider  I get the impression that people are in the businesses of energy efficiency to get rich quickly. Suppliers start on the basis that they want to make a high profit margin …  – Industrial user,### Page 42
41  High transaction costs on small deals act as a significant barrier  Source: Expert estimates, Academic studies including, Easton 1999, Valentova 2010, Mundaca 2007  Typical transaction costs include  •   Financial costs  –   Investment appraisal and feasibility studies  –   Development of proposal and business case  –   Compliance costs (permits, applications)  –   Measurement and reporting costs  –   Legal and accounting fees  •   Time and trouble costs  –   Search for information, project identification  –   Management time in considering and evaluating project  –   Contract negotiations and procurement  –   Production shutdown or disruption of space  70  Project costs  30  Transaction costs   1  Transaction costs as percentage of total EE project costs  Percent  1 Experts estimate transaction costs between 20-40% of total project costs depending on project  A  MARKET MATURITY AND COSTS BARRIERS 2  ILLUSTRATIVE  There are high transaction costs associated with EE, such as potentially closing your business for 2 days. £2,000 is the average annual bill for an SME customer. If you save £200, it’s not worth it. Even at twice that savings rate it doesn’t make sense.  – Utility company  Transaction costs for small deals are really high and generally outweigh the benefits  – Green finance provider  Project costs can include project development time, accounting, audit and legal costs  – Green finance provider  Retrofit takes 6 months of auditing and appropriately base lining (to illustrate savings), followed by a year of disruption.  – Utility company,### Page 43
42  Residential – key insights  Source: Interviews  3  Opportunities for behavioural change B  •   Behavioural change appears to be a significant opportunity in the residential sector, with potential as high as 15%  –   Smart metering could provide granular information, breaking the disconnect between electricity use and high bills with a potential impact of 3-5%  –   Audit and advisory services can help consumers realise greater savings by targeting EE measures to those activities with the largest potential  •   Implementing domestic efficiency measures may require a strong field force – a new capability that not all utility companies will have  Ownership transfer not a key issue A  •   While agency issues persist in rented accommodation, agency issues in form of ownership transfer do not appear to be a significant issue in the UK residential sector (unlike the US)  Drivers of EE in the residential sector might be smart metering and more accurate bills. People need to see the results of actions and get personalised EE advice by data mining  –Utility company  I don’t know if people in the UK are less knowledgeable about EE. In US, they provide information on bills so you know if your average bill is higher than your neighbour’s  – Utility company  •   The average payback period for a residential EE measure is 3 years, while the average UK owner stays in home for 11 years after purchase,### Page 44
43  Unlike the US, ownership transfer issues in the residential sector do not appear to pose a significant challenge  4  11  3  Comparison between energy efficiency investments and home ownership  Years  Source: Unlocking Energy Efficiency in the U.S. Economy, McKinsey (2009); DCLG Survey of English Housing; RICS Economics  Implications Context  •   While ownership transfer does not appear to be a significant factor, it could be perceived to be a barrier as residents are often uncertain about how long they will remain in the property  •   Agency issues between landlord and tenant still affect 32% of residencies in the UK  •   While ownership transfer may be less of an issues, other issues remain, including:  –   Costs of gathering information about potential savings and service providers  –   Significant upfront capital costs relative to average UK resident’s disposable income  –   Transaction costs in form of disruption, loss of interior space, change to exterior of home  •   The ownership transfer barrier applies to owner- occupied homes when the current owner cannot capture the full duration of the benefits  •   To justify the upfront investment, owners facing this barrier would need assurance that they will be able to capture a portion of the future value of the investment upon transfer  Average length of time home owner stays in home after purchase in UK  Average payback period for residential EE measure in UK 1  1 Payback period calculated on private sector basis and includes transaction costs of ~30%  Average length of time home owner stays in home after purchase in US  A  RESIDENTIAL 3,### Page 45
44  Commercial/industrial – key insights (1/2)  Source: Interviews  4  Expectation of rapid payback period A  •   In commercial and industrial sectors, many stakeholders expect a rapid payback years of less than 2 years while many EE investments have a payback period over 2 years  –   While payback periods ranged from 1-5 years, most companies appear to be seeking a payback period of ~2 years  –   EE projects must compete for limited capex with other opportunities such as revenue creation initiatives or global projects in emerging markets such as China  –   The economic crisis has intensified this pattern as uncertainty keeps business focused on the short run  Typically if an efficiency project has a payback period of over one year, it is rejected  – Green financier  We have tens of projects/ year which we constantly evaluate. We are looking for 2-3 year payback period. There are lots of opportunities, but it’s about priority of capex. It’s hard to compete globally if you look to areas such as China where returns on new investments are high.  – Electricity intensive user  Agency issues are significant in commercial sector  B  •   Agency issues in the commercial sector appear to be a significant barrier  –   61% of commercial space is leased so companies are not incentivised to implement EE measures  –   75% of corporations outsource their facilities management capabilities, often without incentives for reducing energy costs  We must work with facility management companies, rather than the customer directly. There is an agency problem- getting through to the decision makers.  – Utility company,### Page 46
45  Commercial/industrial – key insights (2/2)  Source: Interviews  4  Large opportunity with less-intensive industrial users  D  •   Electricity intensive industries have taken significant steps to become more energy efficient as this is key to their competitive advantage. The key opportunity here would be further technological advancement.  •   A bigger opportunity may lie with less electricity intensive industrial users, because it is a smaller portion of total costs. However, in the aggregate the less electricity intensive industries use a significant amount of electricity and present a large opportunity for reduction  Most heavy industries are quite EE except for old kit. There are diminishing returns there. The proportionate scope for EE savings in less intensive industries is much higher  – Industry association  We have numerous KPIs around EE and we track this every minute. We monitor if any plant gives signs of deviation.  – Electricity intensive user  Capital constraints not an issue for large companies  C  •   While capital constraints may be a barrier for SMEs or underperforming companies, large commercial and industrial organisations can secure necessary financing to make an EE investment if attractive  There is no financing issue. Maybe it’s a marginal issue. But be it banks, bonds or self-financing, companies can get the financing if the investment makes sense  – Industry association,### Page 47

There is often an agency problem here because the management company has no incentive to reduce consumption.  – Utility company  Sometime the facilities management company gets paid on number of light bulbs replaced so that doesn’t incentivise them to put in LEDs  – Utility company  We are starting to focus more on the supplier incentive so that the person incentivised to reduce electricity is the person who can influence it most. We are driving innovation- I don’t get the sense that our peers are doing this.  – Commercial user,### Page 49

56  The case studies suggest a number of implications relevant to the UK context (1/2)  Source: Case studies  Key features   Implications for UK market  ISO-NE forward capacity markets  A  •   Forward capacity markets allowing demand side resources to compete with generation  •   Demand side resources represented ~10% of capacity bid into the auction in 2010  •   Efficiency measures (as opposed to demand response) constituted ~35% of the demand side resourced bid into the auction in 2010  •   For one key participant, Efficiency Vermont, ~80% of the portfolio consists of lighting  •   Demand side participation in a capacity market could deliver significant efficiency impact, in addition to demand response  •   Capacity payments could provide sponsors with the incentive and stability to encourage investment in efficiency and compete with generation capacity  •   The role of National Grid would need to be expanded to be equivalent to ISO-NE (potentially addressed through EMR)  PUCT: Energy efficiency programmes  B  •   Utilities satisfy obligations to meet 20% of demand growth through two types of incentive programme:  –   Standard Offer Programmes (SOPs) allowing consumers / aggregators to choose the most cost effective measures  –   Market Transformation Programmes (MTPs) incentivising specific efficiency measures facing structural barriers  •   Limited impact to date (~0.15% of total electricity demand in 2010):  –   Primarily due to targets not being very ambitious (Texas ranked 37   th   out of 42 states in per capita EE budgets)  •   Commercial and industrial represent ~63% of total savings  •   A FiT-like mechanism could be administered through suppliers, which would offset their incentive to sell more electricity  •   Would require clarification of potential overlaps with current supplier obligations, i.e. ECO  •   Could be combined with Green Deal as an additional incentive to providers  •   Due to deregulated pricing in the UK, would require careful setting of incentive rates to ensure manageable cost to customers/taxpayers  –   In Texas, the PUCT explicitly sets limits on reasonable expenditures by utilities that can be passed on to consumers  •   MTP like programmes would allow selection of the highest potential opportunities that might otherwise not be adopted,### Page 58
57  The case studies suggest a number of insights and implications relevant to the UK context (2/2)  Key features   Implications for UK market  Connecticut: Energy saving certificates  C  •   Tradeable certificates issued by the state regulator representing 1 MWh of savings  •   Suppliers obliged to meet 4% of electricity supplied through purchase of ESCs  –   Not all pure energy efficiency – some CHP and micro-generation can participate  •   Regulator specifies a floor price (~$10) and effectively sets a cap by charging suppliers a penalty of ~$31 for obligations not met  –   ESCs typically trade just below this price  •   Allows some degree of prescription as to the efficiency measures incentivised through the eligibility criteria for ESCs  •   Tradeable certificates could promote a market in energy efficiency where the most cost effective efficiency measures set the certificate price  •   Eligibility criteria would need to promote the highest potential opportunities that would otherwise not be adopted  •   Would require careful setting of supplier obligations / certificate prices to ensure that the cost to customers (passed on by the supplier) is manageable  –   ~$35 per capita spent in Connecticut  EPA Portfolio Manager  D  •   Portfolio Manager provides a low cost online benchmarking tool for commercial buildings  •   Energy Star Rating facilitates communication to prospective tenants and buyers, helping overcome agency barriers  •   Benchmarking and online resources effectively act as a low cost audit tools, suggesting highest value efficiency opportunities to overcome lack of awareness  •   Range of variables used in determining performance against benchmarks acts as a dynamic baselining tool, helping to isolate additionality  •   Addresses significant uncaptured potential in commercial and public admin buildings  •   Confidence in benchmarking algorithm is critical in order to generate voluntary participation  •   Participation could be made compulsory for buildings above a defined size  •   Publication of building ratings could be made compulsory to further address agency issue  •   Open question is the extent to which potential tenants and subsequent buyers will consider energy efficiency in decision making  •   For large commercial users, provides more granular tracking and data than CRC  Source: Case studies,### Page 59
58  Key insights from the case studies for design of a market-based incentive mechanism  Key insights  Impact  •   Forward capacity markets are largely technology neutral whereas a FiT would allow targetting of technological or structural barriers  –   Technologies currently not cost effective would not clear a capacity auction  –   FiT incentives can be targeted at specific abatement measures  •   Demand side participation in forward capacity markets facilitates direct offsetting of generation capacity  –   Effectiveness of FiTs is highly dependent on level of incentive and/or demand reduction obligation placed on electricity supplier – risk of over or under-shooting  •   Permanent demand reduction measures have proven to compete cost effectively with demand response in either a capacity market or FiT mechanism  M&V  •   Almost all mechanisms distinguish between simple / deemed M&V for smaller measures and complex M&V for larger measures  •   For forward capacity markets, key consideration is whether the demand reduction is additional to the baseline used by the system operator in projecting capacity required  –   Consequences of failure are potentially an expensive shortfall in capacity  •   For FiTs, ensuring genuine additionality is a challenge that has not been comprehensively addressed by any mechanism:  –   Where possible this is a matter of identifying key parameters that allow a dynamic baseline (e.g., per unit of output) perhaps with a natural efficiency gain factor  –   Detailed project evaluation could address this, but creates an administrative burden, requires industry-specific expertise and faces information asymmetry issues,### Page 60
59  Key characteristics of different archetypes for market-based incentive schemes  Key characteristics  Specificity  Funding capability  Source of funding  Price discovery  Synchronisation with demand (peak vs baseload)  Importance of M&V  Forward capacity market e.g., ISO New England  •   Primary objective of market is to ensure adequate capacity (across supply and demand side) at lowest price: efficiency competes with generation and demand response  •   Technology neutral: does not incentivise currently uneconomic technologies  •   Receives same capacity payments as generators per unit of capacity  •   Market operator pays demand side participants - costs borne by ratepayer  •   Market based: only bids below market price clear the auction  •   Facilitates direct trade offs with generation capacity  •   Will favour projects impacting peak consumption  •   Failure to achieve savings could result in insufficient capacity  •   Additionality to be measured against baseline capacity projection model  Standardised incentive scheme e.g., PUCT Standard Offer Program  •   Objective is to incentivise end use energy efficiency  •   Standardised contracts that are largely technology neutral  •   Depends on pre-determined level of incentive or demand reduction obligation placed on supplier  •   Taxpayer (if run by market operator) or ratepayer (if run through suppliers)  •   Price discovery done by network operator and/or supplier in setting incentive  •   Trade off against capacity implicitly done by network operator or supplier  •   Does not distinguish between different load profiles – addresses total energy usage  Tradeable certificates e.g., Connecticut ESCs  •   Objective is to incentivise end use energy efficiency  •   Generally involves standardised eligibility criteria for certificates  •   Market based: price set through trading of certificates in open market  •   Tends towards simple M&V - additionality considered in setting deemed level of savings  Tailored incentive scheme e.g., PUCT Market Transformation Program  •   Objective is to incentivise end use energy efficiency for specific measures  •   Facilitates incentivisation of technologies at early stage of learning curve or facing other financial or structural barriers  •   Additionality ideally measured by identifying key parameters that allow a dynamic baseline (e.g., per unit of output) perhaps with a natural efficiency gain factor,### Page 61
60  What you would need to believe in order to conclude that market based incentives could address barriers to uncaptured potential being realised  Barrier category   What you need to believe for a market based incentive to be effective Barrier  •   Incentives would result in market participants (e.g., aggregators and ESCOs) conducting awareness campaigns  •   Lack of awareness/info  •   Increased payoff would elevate efficiency to top of mind for key decision-makers  •   Lack of focus  •   Key transaction barriers are capable of being overcome by financial incentives of a reasonable scale  •   Transaction barriers  •   Financial incentives could be large enough to result in significant shortening of payback period to below target period  •   Hurdle rate/ payback period  •   Incentives would result in tenants self-funding investments in buildings or a third party aggregator doing so on their behalf  •   Agency issues  •   Incentive would outweigh risk of production shutdown / interruption •   Risk and uncertainty  •   Availability of incentives would effectively subsidise financing costs or top-up financing where unavailable  •   Capital constraints  •   Incentives would justify R&D costs of investment in new technologies •   Product availability  •   M&V associated with incentives requires sponsors to ensure effective installation/use  •   Installation and use  Attention to opportunity  Financial and non-financial costs  Capturing benefits  Attrac- tiveness  Financing  Execution  Key barriers for commercial and industrial sectors  Bold,### Page 62

102  Case example – ISO New England FCM mechanism (1/2)  Context  •   ISO’s FCM compensates for the structural limitations of the electricity market, such as wholesale price increases when demand is greater than system capacity and missing revenues for generators during peak demand due to spot energy market price caps, by reducing market power and increasing reliability  •   Provides investors with predictable revenue streams as capacity providers receive an up-front, guaranteed payment for committing capacity to the markets, and a second inducement in the form of dispatch payments when there is there is a shortage of capacity  •   Unique market which enables energy efficiency and other demand resources to compete directly with generators  Key facts  ISO NEW ENGLAND A  Source: “Energy efficiency as a resource in the ISO New England forward capacity market” report; ISO NE website; ISO NE “Measurement and Verification of Demand Reduction Value from Demand Resources” manual; annual reports  Description of mechanism  •   Demand side inclusion   – Demand resources were included in New England's FCM in 2006 and includes energy efficiency, demand response and distributed generation projects  •   Forecasting   – ISO-NE forecasts peak capacity needs of the power system three years in advance and holds annual auctions to purchase the power resources needed to satisfy future requirements  •   Auction   – Forward auctions are held three years before the delivery year and the generator’s ‘forward’ capacity obligations and amount of capacity put out to bid are established in advance of each auction  •   Payment   – ISO-NE pays participants during the delivery period based on the delivered capacity/demand reduction and the auction clearing price. Shortfalls in available capacity/demand reduction result in loss of payment, as sponsors are only paid for capacity/demand reduction delivered  •   Certification   – Annual certification of compliance with the approved M&V plan is also required, along with participation in any audits and reviews deemed necessary by ISO-NE  •   Participants   - Demand side participants include the state regulatory agencies in New England, Conservation Services Group, Vermont Energy Investment Corporation, Environment Northeast, Regulatory Assistance Project and Conservation Law Foundation  Impact  •   More than 3,400 MW of demand resources qualified in the first auction in February 2008 (nearly 9% of the total qualified capacity), and 2,554 MW (with 655 MW from energy efficiency) cleared the auction, contributing substantially to eliminating the need for new generating capacity  •   Energy efficient resources have increased from 655 MW (26% share of total demand resources) to 1167 MW (35% share) from the first (Dec 2008) to the fourth auction (Aug 2010)  •   Participants receive FCA credit for delivering capacity/demand reduction equal to the clearing price ($/kW-mo) x cleared capacity (MW) x 1,000  Cost  •   Cost to ISO NE - in 2010 total FCM payments were $856 million  •   Demand side participants have to pay financial assurance which consists of a deposit ($2/kW x total qualified kWs) and the cost of an entry (CONE) in the FCM is ($7.50 per kW of demand capacity)  •   Demand side participants also pay for the energy efficiency measures which encourage demand reduction with their customers  M&V/ addition- ality  •   ISO M&V Standards Manual outlines the minimum requirements  •   Baseline conditions are specified by the participant and involve one of the below methods depending on the demand reduction measure:  –   Historical hourly load or output data if demand reduction is actively controlled by the Project Sponsor  –   Rolling average of historical hourly load or output data over some period prior to the demand reduction if demand reduction is controlled by end use personnel/ energy management systems  –   For projects in which operating equipment is replaced with a more efficient equivalent unit, the baseline condition is the MW load of that operating equipment,### Page 104

105  Principles of Forward Capacity Market auction  •   FCM run by a regional system operator which:  –   Collects supply bids to meet planning targets for regional peak capacity needs  –   Runs a competitive auction to establish capacity prices  –   Procures capacity at the market clearing price to meet the resource adequacy requirements of the region  •   The regional system operator is the sole buyer in this market  •   Load Serving Entities (LSEs) are individually responsible for meeting their customers’ peak loads, and are allocated a pro rata share of the capacity costs incurred by the system operator to meet those loads  •   The forward auctions in ISO-NE are held three years before the delivery year and the LSEs’ ‘forward’ capacity obligations and amount of capacity put out to bid are established in advance of each auction  •   Three years was selected to roughly match the minimum lead time required for the construction or development of new capacity once demand- and supply-side resources receive a price commitment from the auction  •   In particular, it was chosen to reflect a reasonable construction period for new peaking (e.g., gas-fired) power plants, as well as a reasonable “ramp up” period for energy efficiency projects  •   The capacity bid into the market (the “supply curve”) is comprised of capacity commitments (MW) offered by existing and new resources. These markets and associated auction rules are designed to allow new resources, when needed, to set the clearing price. Existing resources are generally “price-takers” in the sense that they are unlikely to set price unless there is over-supply of existing capacity in the region  •   The market clearing price becomes the uniform price for all capacity that clears the auction. That is, the market clearing price is paid to all capacity committed by existing resources and all new resources that have bid into the auction at or below that clearing price  •   Sample calculation of revenue for a successful bidder  –   Assume a service provider cleared 20 MW of demand-side resources in a capacity auction that had a clearing price of $100/MW-day, and that the provider delivered the 20 MW as contracted during the year. The annual revenue stream for the year would be 20 MW * $100/MW-day * 365 days = $730,000  •   Only resources that clear the market receive capacity payments  •   ISO-NE allows new resources to lock in a capacity price for up to five years (with a one-year minimum term), regardless of clearing prices in subsequent auctions  •   Existing resources, including existing demand-side resources, are eligible only for a one-year price commitment  •   ISO-NE impose stiff penalty charges if a unit fails to perform when obligated to run  Source: “Energy efficiency as a resource in the ISO New England forward capacity market” report; ISO NE website  ISO NEW ENGLAND A,### Page 107

107  Advantages and disadvantages of energy markets with forward reserve requirements and centralised capacity markets  Advantages  •   Provides transparent, in-market mechanism for the system operator to acquire necessary resources on behalf of deficient LSEs  •   Multi-year forward commitment period allows additional supply to compete in market, thereby reducing price volatility  •   Supports retail competition by facilitating capacity transactions to address load migration and assist small LSEs  •   Allows incorporation of demand-response in the forward capacity market design, which increases competition and helps reduce system-wide cost of ensuring reliability  •   Allows for locational forward capacity requirements, which further improve pricing and deliverability of capacity in transmission- constrained areas  •   Facilitates monitoring and mitigation of market power  Disadvantages  •   Added complexity of market design imposes high implementation costs for the Regional Transmission Organisation and market participants  •   Complex market design also carries risks of initial design flaws and inefficiencies  •   Lengthy forward commitment periods can increase supplier risks. Also increases risk that suppliers default on their forward obligations  •   Can create political backlash because clearly visible capacity prices draw attention to the high cost of ensuring reliability at current target reserve margins; locked-in forward commitment could appear unnecessarily high cost after change in market conditions reduces resource needs  Source: “Energy Efficiency as a resource in the ISO New England Forward Capacity Markets” report  ISO NEW ENGLAND A,### Page 109

110  Step by step process overview of FCM mechanism (1/2)  Eligible participants and resources   FCM time line   Planning for and qualification of resources   Project “construction”  •   The period of time before each auction is used by resource providers (“project sponsors”) to forecast and plan projects, by ISO- NE to determine the future capacity needs of the region, and by sponsors to work toward qualification of projects to participate in the market  •   After successful participation in an auction, project sponsors undertake the implementation of the project in preparation for the delivery of capacity during the delivery period  •   For the several months before an auction, both project sponsors and ISO-NE undertake forecasting and qualification activities  •   Sponsors of new projects must determine the level of capacity that can be made available for the next (starting three-years out) delivery period and the price the project requires from the auction in order to proceed  •   For efficiency providers this means that a forecast must be developed for the portfolio of measures to be installed and associated capacity savings that will accumulate by a date three years in the future  •   Energy efficiency portfolio must be qualified by ISO-NE to participate in the auction through submission and approval of a formal Qualifications Package, which includes  –   The capacity reduction value, bid price, and bidding strategy to be used in the auction  –   Election of a period of commitment to deliver the capacity reduction at the market, clearing price (1 – 5 years)  –   A plan for customer acquisition to substantiate the project sponsor’s ability to attain the forecast savings,  –   A funding plan for the project to verify financial feasibility  –   A cost analysis to support any proposed bid price below ISO-NE’s threshold for Market  –   Monitor review – required to ensure that low-cost projects are legitimate and are not using low bids to undermine the auction process or to corner the market  –   A plan for the measurement and verification (M&V plan) of the project’s capacity reduction value  •   Different types of capacity resources are eligible to participate in the FCM on an equal footing, including: traditional power generation; intermittent resources and demand resources  •   Demand resources can participate in any of several categories, including real-time demand response, load management, distributed generation, and energy efficiency  •   The FCM is the first capacity market in the country to allow energy efficiency assets to participate as a resource in a capacity market – capacity reduction is fully equivalent to capacity supply  •   Participants have to meet specified eligibility requirements, payment of dues, and providing financial assurance to back commitments  •   Membership is in different “sectors,” with energy efficiency classified as part of a sector labeled “Alternative Resources”  •   The three-year lead time from auction to delivery period is designed to allow sufficient time for the construction or development of new resources once they receive a price commitment from the auction  •   For energy efficiency projects, this is a “ramp-up” period, with capacity reduction capacity growing as measures that make up the project are installed  •   In order to assess that sufficient progress is being made toward the final commitment, ISO-NE requires that projects submit as a part of their Qualifications Package a schedule of capacity reduction milestones  •   Values of capacity reduction reached as of these interim dates will be reported and the approved M&V plan will be used to verify performance  •   Auctions for capacity in subsequent commitment years must include resources that have not been committed in prior auctions  Description  1   2   3   4  ISO NEW ENGLAND A,### Page 112
111  Step by step process overview of FCM mechanism (2/2)  Delivery period  •   Monthly reports of delivered capacity are required during the delivery period, and payments are received based on the delivered capacity and the auction clearing price for that delivery period  •   Shortfalls in available capacity result in loss of payment, as sponsors are only paid for capacity delivered  •   Annual certification of compliance with the approved M&V plan is also required, along with participation in any audits and reviews deemed necessary by ISO-NE  •   All existing resources receive a one- year commitment to provide capacity, paid at the clearing price of the auction associated with the delivery period. New resources have elected delivery periods of from one to five years, in annual increments, as a part of their auction bid  •   For that delivery period, they will receive the guaranteed price determined by the auction clearing price, allowing them to lock in a price regardless of the clearing price in subsequent auctions  Auction mechanics  •   The FCM auctions are live, Internet- based auctions conducted over several days  •   Prior to each auction, ISO-NE publishes the capacity they seek to procure in the auction (the ICR for the associated delivery period) and, for the first three auctions, administratively determined maximum (starting) and minimum (floor) prices  •   The bidding begins with all qualified resources in at the starting price, and proceeds in a “descending clock” auction, with resources withdrawing at prices below what they deem acceptable  •   Prices continue to fall in each subsequent round as long as there is still excess capacity on offer. The auction ends when either there is no longer excess capacity or the price reaches the auction floor price  Financial assurance  •   As a means of guarantee against the consequences of failure of projects to deliver their capacity obligations, ISO-NE requires sponsors of all new resource projects (supply and demand) to provide financial assurance against non-performance.  •   Deposits are due at several interim points throughout the construction period, to be released once the project is declared “commercial” and tested or verified for its full capacity rating at the delivery date. If the resource is only capable of delivering less than the amount of its commitment, the project sponsor forfeits the portion of its financial assurance associated with the capacity shortfall  Transition period rules  •   Because the delivery period associated with the first FCM auction does not begin until June 2010, the Market Rules define a Transition Period to bridge to the FCM, during which capacity payments are made to all listed and qualified capacity providers  •   These monthly payments, begun in December 2006 and running through May 2010, include payments to new energy efficiency assets submitted by market participants that qualify and register in the market  •   Fixed payment levels, equal for all asset types, were set in advance by the Market Rules and increase each year from $3.05 per kW-month in 2006 to $4.10 per kW-month in 2010  •   Energy efficiency and other demand resource installations, undertaken as part of merchant, utility, or state- sponsored programs and totaling for any project at least 100 kW of peak capacity reduction aggregated within a single Load Zone, are considered qualified capacity for the transition period, subject to ISO-NE review of their measurement and verification processes  •   Project sponsors are required to submit M&V plans that meet the requirements of the Market Rule  •   For efficiency programs, review and approval by the appropriate state regulatory agency with jurisdiction over the utility or state-sponsored program is considered an adequate independent review process for transition period capacity  Description  5   6   7   8  ISO NEW ENGLAND A,### Page 113

113  Case example – Texas energy efficiency programmes (1/2)  Context  •   State of Texas passed a series of laws requiring utility companies (investor owned utilities- IOUs) to meet energy efficiency goals. Currently they must meet at least 20% of their annual growth in electricity demand through energy efficiency programmes  •   All programs are designed to reduce system peak demand, energy consumption, or energy costs through either standard offer programs (SOPs) or targeted market transformation programs (MTPs)  Key facts  PUCT – ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMMES B  Source: Energy Efficiency Accomplishments of Texas Investor Owned Utilities Calendar Year 2010 report; Utility company reports  Description of mechanism  •   Energy incentive programmes   - Utilities are required to administer energy savings incentive programmes, which are implemented through energy efficiency service providers (EESPs) and retail electric providers (REPs) through contracts  •   SOPs and MTPs   - Utilities must achieve their energy efficiency goals either through SOPs or MTPs  •   Customers   - Programmes are made available to all customers, which gives each customer a choice of a variety of energy efficiency alternatives  •   Customer targeting   - Both national and local EESPs contact consumers (residential and commercial) about performing work to save energy and reduce their electric bills  •   Selection   - Customers select the EESP, decide what equipment will be installed, and choose what work the contractor does  •   Financial incentives   - Utilities’ programs pay project sponsors financial incentives to offset the costs of a variety of energy efficiency improvements. Incentive rates are set for each kW of demand reduction and each kWh of energy savings produced and are based on avoided costs  Impact  •   Collectively the utilities in 2010 achieved 533 gigawatt hours (GWh) of energy reduction and 301 megawatts (MW) of peak demand reduction, which was 118% above their 138 MW goal  •   Between 1999 and 2010, the utilities’ programmes implemented after electric industry restructuring in Texas have produced 1,666 MW of peak demand reduction and 4,110 GWh of electricity savings  •   A utility that exceeds its demand reduction goal at a cost that does not exceed the limit established is awarded a performance bonus on an annual basis (a utility that exceeds 100% of its demand reduction goal receives a bonus equal to 1% of the net benefits for every 2% that the demand reduction is exceeded, up to a maximum of 20%)  Cost  •   All IOUs spent an approximate total of $105 million on energy efficiency programs (including administrative expenses) in 2010  M&V/ addition- ality  •   Project sponsors are responsible for planning and conducting all the M&V activities associated with their projects and are required to submit an M&V plan that describes the specific activities, tools, and calculations the sponsor intends to use to determine the projects' actual savings (an industry accepted M&V protocol)  •   M&V guidance provided by IOUs to establish baselines depends on the measure involved and is either:  –   Simple M&V - uses stipulated values for data such as operating hours and equipment efficiencies  –   Full M&V - higher level of rigor involving the application of end-use metering, billing regression analysis or computer simulation (project sponsors must use a full M&V approach for measures that do not meet the criteria for a simplified M&V approach),### Page 115

Utilities pay incentives to project sponsors for certain measures installed in new or retrofit applications that provide verifiable demand and energy savings. Typical projects include the replacement of existing chillers and lighting equipment with more efficient chillers and lighting, and industrial process retrofits  Residential and small commercial  •   The Residential and Small Commercial program targets residential and small commercial customers including multi-family, single-family, and mobile homes. The program provides incentives for the installation of a wide range of measures that reduce system peak demand, energy consumption and energy costs. Retrofits and efficient new construction of low-income housing may also be undertaken  •   Utilities pay incentives to EESPs. These incentives are based on deemed savings when available. (Deemed savings estimates are predetermined, validated estimates of energy and peak demand savings attributable to an energy efficiency measure.) Otherwise, the EESPs set incentives based off actual peak demand reduction and energy savings as verified using the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol  •   The primary objective of the Residential and Small Commercial SOP is to achieve cost- effective reduction in energy consumption during peak summer demand. There are five additional objectives of the program: (1) to encourage private sector delivery of energy efficiency products and services; (2) to achieve customer energy and cost savings; (3) to significantly reduce barriers to participation by streamlining program procedures and M&V requirements; (4) to encourage participation by a wide range of EESPs; and (5) to produce demand, energy, and bill savings in new single-family affordable housing projects and in new multifamily projects  Hard-to-reach  •   The Hard-to-Reach program encourages energy efficiency improvements in households with annual incomes at or below 200% of the federal poverty guideline. It is designed to be a comprehensive program by emphasizing first improving the building shell and then addressing end uses. It is a retrofit program that targets multi-family, single-family, and mobile homes  •   Incentives are paid to project sponsors for eligible measures that provide verifiable demand and energy savings. Special measures include the replacement of incandescent light bulbs with compact fluorescent lighting and water savers  Load manage- ment  •   Load Management programs encourage electric load control or shifting of electric loads in C&I facilities. Participating project sponsors provide on-call, voluntary curtailment of electric consumption during peak demand periods in return for incentive payments. The program is designed to assist businesses to reduce their on-peak energy demand and help meet the state’s energy efficiency goals.

124  Case example – Energy saving certificates (ESCs) (1/2)  Description of mechanism  Context  •   In the US, many states have established efficiency targets by passing an Energy Efficiency Resource Standard (EERS) or a Renewable Electricity Standard (RES) that require a percentage of MWh growth to be met with efficiency, or that efficiency be used to meet a specified percentage of annual load growth  •   Several states (including Connecticut, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey) have included provisions in their legislation that would allow third parties, such as commercial and industrial customers, to generate ESCs and sell them to utilities that are seeking to comply with energy efficiency targets  Key facts  Impact  •   In Connecticut the ESC market was estimated to be valued at $8- $10 million in 2007, $16-$20 million in 2008, $26-$30 million in 2009, and $34-$38 million in 2010 (equates to 1.2 TWh of energy savings assuming total ESCs in 2010 were valued at $36 million with an average price of $30/MWh)  •   In 2007 there was an excess of supply with 907,891 ESCs exceeding the estimated demand, 640,740 ESCs, for EEPS in 2008  Cost  •   In July 2008, the trading price for ESCs in Connecticut was $26.75/MWh  •   Since its introduction the indicative prices of ESCs have generally been between $20 and $30/MWh (floor price is $10)  •   An alternative compliance payment (ACP) of $31/MWh is charged to utilities that fail to meet their efficiency targets  •   Ratepayer support for EE amounted to ~$115m in 2008  ENERGY SAVING CERTIFICATES – CONNECTICUT C  Source:   Energy Savings Certificates report by the World Resources Institute; The Creation of an Energy Efficiency Resource Standard and the Process for Allowing Residential Aggregation report; Energy savings certificates: Toward best practices and standards report  •   Tradable certificates   - ESCs are tradable certificates issued by the state regulator, similar to renewable energy certificates (RECs), that typically represent one megawatt- hour (MWh) of energy savings from efficiency projects (also known as energy efficiency certificates or credits (EECs), white certificates or tradable white certificates (TWCs) and “white tags”)  •   Investment in energy efficiency   - ESCs offer utilities a flexible means of achieving energy efficiency targets while rewarding commercial and industrial companies that are successful in reducing energy use with an additional revenue stream that may improve the economics of a project  •   Financing   - Commercial and industrial companies may choose to implement eligible projects independently or seek financing from a third party, such as a utility or a clean energy fund, often in exchange for future ownership of the credits  •   Trading market   - Each ESC represent one MWh of electricity usage avoided and only Connecticut has an active trading market where the minimum floor is set by public utility  •   Project coverage   - guidelines for energy efficiency projects are established by each state’s specific legislation. Examples include commercial and industrial lighting upgrades, cogeneration or combined heat and power (CHP) and increased efficiency of HVAC systems and improved insulation  M&V/ addition- ality  •   The baseline can be established in a number of ways and depends on the specific market design rules  –   “Deemed savings” figures (end-use consumption and then imputing savings based on a projection of baseline energy use, or conducting whole building measurement )  –   Engineering calculations  –   Direct measurement  –   Measured factors  –   System monitoring  –   Modelled savings  •   ESCs generally require licensed engineering contractors to conduct the work or independently verify the savings,### Page 126

126  Explanation of ESCs  Example of an ESC created from the earth markets community energy savings project – lighting  The market  Despite the number of registered ESCs (907, 891) exceeding the estimated demand (640, 740) for the EEPS in 2008, the price appeared to be near the DPUC-established ACP of USD 31. One would expect if the market for ESCs is in surplus (267, 151), then the associated price would approach the floor price of USD 10, but this has not been the case.
